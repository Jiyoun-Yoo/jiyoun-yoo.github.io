# New Start

Since last July, I've been studying Computer Programming. And now I finally got a chance to start my new career in the Computer industries. It was hard to keep studying everyday, but I tried. After I finished a course from the academy, I prepared my resume and portfolio for a week without any rest. 

Right after I finished writing my resume, I found a good opportunity and applied for it. It was a job opening from a financial company who wanted a new web programmer. I was not pretty sure that I was competitive, but I got a call for the interview. And I had an interview with them and they were really nice. And I also liked their building. I really wanted to get the chance. The interview lasted for 30 mins, the I got some questions about my career path. I told them about my study plan and my interests, experience, and my recent project. And on my way home after the interview, I got a call from them telling that I passed interview and they wanted me to work for them. I accepted it, and I'm waiting to start new work. 

I'm happy because it's a good start of 2021 and my new career path. I'll study more about web programming field, and want to be a real web developer.
