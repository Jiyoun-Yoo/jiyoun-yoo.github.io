# About My Plan

In the beginning of this year, I didn't wrote down any New Year's Resolution, but I have goals for this year. I want to be more stable. When I was little, 30ish is an old enough age to have a stable life, but I'm 30ish now and still unstable. I still try to study more to be professional and I still live with my parents.

I'm planning to have another job in a new industries, and I've been studying for it since Jul of last year. At first, it was not easy to decide like that. Because I had a job and it means I had a regular income. But for a better future, I gave up all and started over. I was interested in Computer Programming and I decided to do that. I studied at leat 10 hours a day, and it repeated every day. And at the end of last year, I finished a web programming course from an computer education institute. These days, I'm making portfolio and writing a resume. I want to be a web developer. For that, I won't stop studying and try to keep learning new technologies. 

Also, I want to take a better care of my mental health, so that I can be metally strong. It's because I think mental health is important for a happy life. We can overcome difficult situations if we're mentaly strong.  I think it might needs a lot of effort, but I'll try to be more healthy.
