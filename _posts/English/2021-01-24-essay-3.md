# Clean My Room

I'm starting a new job from tomorrow, and I wanted to prepare for it today. I woke up early this morning, and started cleaning my room. I vacuumed the floor and tried get rid of all the dust on the furniture. I clean my room quite often, but I got shocked because my room was very messy. I think it's beacuse I have more than enough stuff in the room. I try to take out unuseful items regulary, but it might not have woked properly. 
I might have to stop buying things that are not essential, and should give it a second thought what to buy. And also, I think I have to spend at least 20 minutes every night to tidy up my room. And the most important thing is take away garbages from packages. I usually order things online, so they produce a lot of wrapping garbages. And they really make my room messy.
I'm still on the process of cleaning my room, after dinner I might start to organize my closet which has a lot of clothes I don't wear. I'll just throw out all of them without thinking that is a waste of money.
I'm not really sure I can do it, but I'll try to live a minialist life. I'll buy what I really have to buy , and make great a use of them. It may help me with saving my money and keeping my room clean.
